Details:
- This is a reference implementation of the Bookmark Manager web listener for servers.
- Its purpose is to handle HTTP requests to fetch the latest connection string for your Unturned server(s).
- This is useful for servers whose IP addresses change frequently, such as those using Unturned's FakeIP feature.
- When your Unturned server changes its IP address, clients who have bookmarked your server(s) in-game can query the listener to grab its new connection details.
- The listener supports multiple servers by the same owner.

Usage Instructions:
- This web listener must be hosted on a NodeJS web server.
- To run locally, you must have NodeJS installed. Browse to its extracted folder and run the command "node index.js".
- The server runs on Port 3000 by default. You can change this by altering the "ListenerPORT" line in the "index.js" file.
- On first use, update the configuration file "ServerCfg.json" to include a short name and the GSLT (Steam Login Token) for your server(s). 
The "ConnString" field is updated automatically by the Unturned server. For now, you can leave the default values in place.
- The web listener can be queried via the "?server=" query string once set up ("http://your-domain.here/?server=<shortname>"). You can use your web browser to perform a test query.
- Once successfully tested, enter this URL into your Unturned server's "BookmarkHost" setting in its Config.json file. For example, "BookmarkHost" = "http://mydomain.com/?server=server1".

Automatically Updating the Listener:
- Your Unturned server can automatically update the web listener with its latest connection information when its FakeIP changes.
- In order to use this feature, you must install the BookmarkHostUpdater plugin on your server.
- You must also enter your server's Steam Login Token (GSLT) into the "Login_Token" setting of its Config.json file.
